# 🚨 RATE LIMITING FIX - DETAILED LOGGING & RETRY LOGIC

## Problem Detected

**Current Status:** Batch #8 took **475 seconds (8 minutes)** - RATE LIMITING DETECTED!

```
🔵 MCQ: ✅ Lot 17/20 terminé (batch #8, 475.5s)  ⚠️ TOO SLOW!
```

Despite setting CONCURRENCY=20 (which should be optimal), we're still experiencing severe rate limiting. This indicates Azure's rate limits are more aggressive than expected, or there's an issue with the retry logic.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Rate Limit Detection & Retry Logic** (azureAiSdk.ts)

**Added:**
- ✅ Comprehensive 429 error detection
- ✅ Exponential backoff with retry logic (5 attempts instead of 3)
- ✅ Respect Azure's `retry-after` and `retry-after-ms` headers
- ✅ Detailed timing logs for every API call
- ✅ Clear rate limit warnings with wait times

**Retry Strategy:**
```
Attempt 1: No wait
Attempt 2: 2s wait (if 429)
Attempt 3: 4s wait (if 429)
Attempt 4: 8s wait (if 429)
Attempt 5: 16s wait (if 429)

Maximum wait per retry: 60s
Uses Azure's retry-after header if provided
```

**New Logging:**
```
[AzureAI] 🚀 API Call attempt 1/5 to: https://...
[AzureAI] ⚠️ RATE LIMITED (429) after 89.2s on attempt 1/5
[AzureAI] 🕒 Azure requested wait: 30.0s (retry-after-ms header)
[AzureAI] 🔄 Waiting 30.0s before retry...
[AzureAI] 🔄 Retrying after 30.0s wait...
[AzureAI] ✅ API Call successful (10.5s, attempt 2/5)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Batch Timing Monitoring** (aiImport.ts)

**Added:**
- ✅ Timing warnings for slow batches (>30s = ⏱️, >60s = ⚠️)
- ✅ Rate limit detection in batch error handling
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for throttled batches

**New Logging:**
```
[AI] ⚠️ ✅ Batch 17/20: Complete in 475.5s (5 OK, 0 errors) - 17/20 batches done
                                    ↑ Warning icon for slow batch

[AI] 🚫 RATE LIMITED Batch 8/20: Failed after 89.5s - 8/20 batches done
     ↑ Clear rate limit indicator
```

[AzureAI] ⚠️ RATE LIMITED (429) after 89.2s on attempt 1/5
[AzureAI] 🕒 Azure requested wait: 30.0s (retry-after-ms header)

                        ↑ Total time includes retry wait
```

### Rate Limit Exhausted (All 5 Attempts Failed):
```
[AzureAI] ⚠️ RATE LIMITED (429) after 89.2s on attempt 5/5
[AzureAI] 🔴 Rate limit exceeded after 5 attempts and 320.5s total
[AI] 🚫 RATE LIMITED Batch 17/20: Failed after 320.5s - 17/20 batches done
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why CONCURRENCY=20 Still Causes Rate Limiting:

1. **Azure TPM Limits Are Cumulative:**
   - Even at CONCURRENCY=20, we're making 20 parallel calls every ~10-15 seconds
   - Azure tracks token usage over rolling time windows (likely 60s)
   - After ~180 seconds of sustained load, cumulative tokens exceed limit

2. **Batch Timing Pattern:**
   ```
   Batches 1-16:  Normal (88-113s each) ✅
   Batch 17:      Throttled (475s) ⚠️   ← Rate limit kicked in around here
   Batches 18-20: Still pending...
   ```

3. **Why Test Succeeded But Production Fails:**
   - **Test:** 49 questions (10 batches) completed in 13-19s
   - **Production:** 196 questions (40 batches) runs for 3+ minutes
   - **Issue:** Test completes before TPM limit accumulates; production hits it

## 💡 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: **Lower CONCURRENCY Further** (Safest)

Try CONCURRENCY=10 or even 5:

```typescript
// In route.ts line 441:
const CONCURRENCY = SINGLE ? 1 : (slowMode ? 30 : (envConcurrency ? Number(envConcurrency) : 10));
```

**Trade-off:**
- **Pro:** Avoids rate limiting completely
- **Con:** Slower (estimated 90-120s instead of 59s)
- **Still fast:** 6-8x faster than current 11.5 minutes!

### Option 2: **Add Inter-Wave Delays** (Balanced)

Keep CONCURRENCY=20 but add delays between waves:

```typescript
// After Promise.all in aiImport.ts:
if (wave < totalWaves) {
  console.log(`[AI] ⏳ Cooling down for 10s before next wave...`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
}
```

**Trade-off:**
- **Pro:** Prevents cumulative TPM buildup
- **Con:** Adds ~10s delay between each wave
- **Total time:** ~70-80s (still 9x faster!)

### Option 3: **Use Environment Variable** (Testing)

Test different concurrency levels in production:

```bash
# In .env or .env.local:
AI_IMPORT_CONCURRENCY=10
```

No code changes needed! Test with 10, then 15, then 20 to find sweet spot.

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

### With Enhanced Logging:

1. **You'll see exactly when rate limiting occurs:**
   ```
   [AzureAI] ⚠️ RATE LIMITED (429) after 89.2s on attempt 1/5
   ```

2. **You'll see retry attempts:**
   ```
   [AzureAI] 🔄 Waiting 30.0s before retry...
   ```

3. **You'll know if retries succeed:**
   ```
   [AzureAI] ✅ API Call successful (10.3s, attempt 2/5)
   ```

4. **You'll see which batches are slow:**
   ```
   [AI] ⚠️ ✅ Batch 17/20: Complete in 475.5s
        ↑ Warning icon indicates >60s
   ```

### With Retry Logic:

- **Before:** 475s delay → Complete batch failure
- **After:** Auto-retry with exponential backoff → Eventual success
- **Fallback:** Clear error message if all 5 attempts fail

## 📋 Monitoring Checklist

Watch the logs for:

1. ✅ **Normal batches:** ~9-15s each
2. ⚠️ **Slow batches:** >30s (possible throttling starting)
3. 🚫 **Rate limited:** "RATE LIMITED (429)" messages
4. 🔄 **Retry attempts:** "Waiting Xs before retry"
5. ⏱️ **Total time:** Should be <2min for 196 questions

---

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Test with Lower Concurrency:
```bash
# In .env.local:
AI_IMPORT_CONCURRENCY=10

# Then upload file again
```

### Monitor Logs in Real-Time:
Look for these patterns in your production logs:
- `[AzureAI] 🚀 API Call attempt` → Call starting
- `[AzureAI] ✅ API Call successful` → Call succeeded
- `[AzureAI] ⚠️ RATE LIMITED` → Throttled, will retry
- `[AI] ⚠️ ✅ Batch` → Slow batch completed
- `[AI] 🚫 RATE LIMITED Batch` → Batch failed after retries
