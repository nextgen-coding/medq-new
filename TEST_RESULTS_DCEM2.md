## 5️⃣ Data Quality Observations

### ✅ Strengths:
1. **Perfect sheet naming** - All sheets use correct keywords (qcm, qroc, cas_qcm, cas_qroc)
2. **No empty rows** - Clean data, no wasted processing
3. **Consistent structure** - All sheets have 49 data rows each
4. **Complete metadata** - All questions have Matière and Cours
5. **Balanced dataset** - Equal distribution across all 4 question types

### 📋 Observations:
1. **"Pas de reponse" answers** - These will be processed by AI to determine correct answers
2. **Matière naming** - "pediatrie 2*" (with asterisk) - this is fine, will be processed correctly
3. **Some incomplete MCQ options** - Only showing A and B in samples, but this is normal if questions have fewer than 5 options

## 🔍 How to Verify Results

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you upload the file, compare the console output with the "Expected Console Logs" section above. They should match exactly.

### 2. Check Question Count
The UI should show:
```
🧠 Démarrage IA MCQ: 98 questions
📋 Total: 98 MCQ + 98 QROC = 196 questions
```

If you see a different number (like 2749), there's an issue with the filtering.

### 3. Check Batch Count
You should see:
```
📦 Création des lots (taille: 50, parallèle: 50)
```

For MCQ: 2 batches (98 ÷ 50 = 1.96 → 2 batches)
For QROC: 2 batches (98 ÷ 50 = 1.96 → 2 batches)

### 4. Check Progress Messages
Progress should show actual questions:
```
🚀 Lot 1/2 démarré • Progression: 0% (0/98 questions, 0/2 lots)
✅ Lot 1/2 terminé (2.3s) • Progression: 51% (50/98 questions, 1/2 lots)
```
